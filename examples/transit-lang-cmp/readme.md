# Transit language comparison

The challenge / puzzle and data came from this repo: 
https://github.com/losvedir/transit-lang-cmp

At the time of writing there were solutions for mostly static languages like:
- Go
- C#
- Typescript
- Scala
- F#

I will make a blogpost about this on the Rye blog. Short code in Rye's case
is mostly due to the very high level datatype Table. More about thinking
around it here:

Thanks to https://github.com/losvedir for a nice challenge :)

To run you need to download two CSV files. They are around 100MB so they aren't in the repo. And rename them from .csv to .big.csv.
(This naming is for the .gitignore)
